        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
            This site provides a searchable database of links to translations of non-explicit Touhou doujinshi. Here,
            <i>doujinshi</i> refers to self-published manga, magazines, and fan-works (though this term often
            colloquially refers to explicit fan-works).
        </p>

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            These graphs are updated automatically on a daily basis and only include data pertaining to non-explicit
            Touhou works.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Number of translated works over time</h3>
            {{ plot("languages") }}
            <p>
                Only the main languages are shown in this graph. This site predominantly pulls data from English
                sources which means this graph is biased towards English translations and is not representative
                of the Touhou translation space as a whole.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Number of uploads on websites over time</h3>
            {{ plot("websites") }}
            <p>
                On Dynasty Scans, works go by a translation's release date, not its upload date. The release date
                refers to when a translation was first published and accessible, which may include sites outside of
                Dynasty Scans.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Common page counts in works</h3>
            {{ plot("page-counts") }}
            <p>
                Only works with a page count of 100 or less are included in this histogram.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Character appearances over time</h3>
            {{ plot("characters") }}
            <p>
                Only characters with more than 500 appearances are shown. This graph is based on the presence of
                character tags on works, which may bias sites such as Dynasty Scans and Danbooru that tend to have more
                character tags. Character tags from metadata sites such as doujinshi.org are included.
